Python API Homework - What's the Weather Like?

Part 1: See directory 'WeatherPy'

Observable trends for global weather on 23Jan2021:
- Maximum temperature tended to be lowest in cities furthest from the equator (Latitude 0).
    - See "lat_temp_scatter.png", "north_lat_temp_regression.png", and "south_lat_temp_regression.png"
- Wind speed tends to decrease torward to the equator, though the difference was more pronounced in the southern hemisphere.
    - See "north_lat_wind_regression.png" and "south_lat_wind_regression.png"
- Cloudiness increased toward the equator in the southern hemisphere, and continued to increase in the northern hemisphere.
    - See "north_lat_cloud_regression.png" and "south_lat_cloud_regression.png"
    - Many data points were found on the lower and upper bounds of cloudiness (i.e. 0% and 100%), possibly indicating greater variance.
- Humidity increased toward the equator in the southern hemisphere, and continued to increase in the northern hemisphere.
    - See "north_lat_humid_regression.png" and "south_lat_humid_regression.png"
